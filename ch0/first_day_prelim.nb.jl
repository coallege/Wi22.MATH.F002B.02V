| ``a`` is an element of ``b`` | ``a \in b`` |
| ``a`` is a *proper* subset of ``b`` | ``a \subset b``
| ``a`` is a subset of ``b`` | ``a \subseteq b``
| For all ``f``, there exists a ``g`` such that f(x, y) = (g(x))(y) | ``\forall f \exists g\text{ s.t. }f(x,y)=(g(x))(y)``

### an example:

```math
\forall x\in\mathbb{R},\exists!y\in\mathbb{R}\text{ s.t. }y=x^2
```

> Forall x (where x is a real number) there exists a y where y = x^2

Basically, the output of ``f(x)=x^2`` is Real so long as the input value ``x`` is Real.

## Logic and Reasoning

- Statement: "If a is an Apple, then a is a Fruit"
- Converse: "If a is a Fruit, then a is an Apple"
- Inverse: "If a is not an Apple, then a is not a Fruit"
- Contrapositive: "If a is not a Fruit, then a is not an Apple"

Statement and Contrapositive mean the same thing.
Converse and Inverse mean the same thing.
