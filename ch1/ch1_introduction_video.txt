Hello hello, my name is Cole and I'm a second year student at De Anza. I'm
taking this class mainly to dodge the prerequisite of Math 1D that I would
otherwise have to take at De Anza. I'm not very confident with my math skills so
I'm really hoping I don't get utterly flensed by the content that we're all
learning. When I was better at math, I enjoyed it more and really got to see
some of the beauty in the understanding. Maybe during this course, I'll be able
to gain a little more appreciation. My two prior college level math courses have
been completely asynchronous with optional lectures and I was frequently behind.
I'm hoping that maybe with a more traditional learning structure like we have
here, I'll be able to absorb more. A few uninteresting facts about me is that I
enjoy going out for walks and bikes near water and I have a really big sweet
tooth. See you all in class this coming Tuesday.
